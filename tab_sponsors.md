There are many ways you can help the OWASP Vilnius Chapter spread a word about the application security and any security topics in general. Including the following:  
- If you have a room available to hold a meeting, let us know.
- Supply a speaker on a topic of interest to the OWASP Vilnius members, or cover their costs to present.
- Sponsor food and drink for a session.

## Welcome to the OWASP Vilnius Chapter Homepage

Lithuania has an evolved software development community and one of the
most important aspects that we aim to achieve - continuously improve
the application security world.

Everyone is welcome to join our chapter meetings, members and
non-members. OWASP chapter meetings / events are free and
open, so please join us !

The chapter leader are [Dominykas Šeikis](mailto:dominykas.seikis@owasp.org) and [Miroslav Lučinskij](mailto:miroslav.lucinskij@owasp.org)

### Call For Speakers

Call For Speakers is open. If you want to present a talk at one of our meetings / events please review and agree with the
[OWASP Speaker Agreement](https://owasp.org/www-policy/legal/speaker-agreement) and send the proposed talk title, abstract and speaker bio to the [Chapter Leaders](leaders.md) via e-mail.  

### Become a Sponsor

To sponsor an OWASP Vilnius event, contact [Dominykas Seikis](mailto:dominykas.seikis@owasp.org).

We don't have any special sponsorship package, however the sponsoring organization or individual will receive our warm thanks and a fair
amount of gratitude spread over our social media presence, placed at the chapter official web-page, and announced at the event itself.

## Welcome to the OWASP Vilnius Chapter Homepage

Lithuania has an evolved software development community and one of the
most important aspects that we aim to achieve is to continuously improve
the application security world.

Everyone is welcome to join our chapter meetings, members and
non-members. OWASP Lithuania Chapter meetings / events are free and
open, so please join us !

The chapter leader are [Dominykas Šeikis](mailto:dominykas.seikis@owasp.org) and [Miroslav Lučinskij](mailto:miroslav.lucinskij@owasp.org)

## Call For Speakers

Call For Speakers is open. If you want to present a talk at one of our meetings / events please review and agree with the
[OWASP Speaker Agreement](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Speaker_Agreement)) and send the proposed talk title, abstract and speaker bio to the [Chapter Leaders](leaders.md) via e-mail.  

## Become a Sponsor

To sponsor an OWASP Vilnius event, contact [Dominykas Seikis](mailto:dominykas.seikis@owasp.org).

We don't have any special sponsorship package, however the sponsoring organization or individual will receive our warm thanks and a fair
amount of gratitude spread over our social media presence, placed at the chapter official web-page, and announced at the event itself.
